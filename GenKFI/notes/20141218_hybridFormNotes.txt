1) Added columns fcurTotalAmount and fcurRefundableAmount to tblPitCRS
2) Add column in rfrControlHeaders, fblnHybridForm
3) Add a checkbox on form builder for "hybrid form"
4) If a form is a hybrid, get the blockNum + 1 and build that form also and tack on the end of the current form.
	a) how do we know not to use the next block and just continue on
	b) when building the queues, which is where the block and form and order info is taken, exclude any form after a hybrid form
	c) The alignment is going to be off
		i) We might be able to get the offset of the control, and add that to the stored alignment numbers?

This is getting complex, to get around a simple two field block
Do we really want to do all this? It's won't really be used much

Is there another way around this? To get extra non-repeated fields on a repeater form?
