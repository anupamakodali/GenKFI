start on existForms.aspx
	list all forms from rfrControls, grouped by tax program, tax year, and file type, link to blockBatch.aspx
	also include a button for creating a new form
	the new form we can put the values in the rfrControls table, with flngOrder = 0, for the declaration value that the form will exist
	 also use that method to get existing form header (declarations)

move on to blockBatch.aspx
	for entire batch, user can set tax program, tax year, file type
	then user can start adding tax forms (name and template image file location), tables, and blocks
		blocks are a subset of the tax forms
		each tax form is associated with one table

for each tax form, table and block, a button will take user to controlEdit.aspx
	this will load the template image (set on previous page) and user can start adding controls
	header has the following controls
		control type DDL
		add control
		save edits
		remove control
		move control up in sequence
		move control down in sequence
		move control right (vert skip)
		move control vertical (no vert skip)
		test controls button (go to text page)

	each control has the following properties (properties window?)
		checkbox for which control is currently being edited
		textbox for label
		textbox for GenTax field
		the control itself (type selected when adding)
		two text boxes for x and y of marker position
		two textboxes for image scroll position
		DDL for type of data
		DDL for formatting (if any)
		DDL for control div scrolling (0, 10, 20, etc.)
