Questions/Features on GenKFI
- Should batches be able to be assigned to multiple users?
- Should users still have the ability to choose the batch and return to key, or simply force them to continue to the next one queued?
- How should the users batches and queues be ordered? Currently it's by Batch Date, BatchID, and Return
