** block/batch edit page:
start on a block and page list edit page
	find how the batches get the page sequences and block values
the normal add/edit/remove/edit control buttons
we will probably need to set this up before anything is in the batch
	so we need to know what tblBatchImage.fstrTaxProgram and tblBatchImage.fstrFormName will be, since that is what we will be using to relate to the controls
	each block will have those values, plus the fileType and taxYear (set by batch? set here for all the forms)
		and then table and block set here, same for all controls by block number
	when adding a new tax form, flngOrder and flngBlock are both 0
	NEW when adding a new block, add another declaration row with flngOrder = 0 and flngBlock incremented
		changed BatchModify.aspx added fnlgBlock = 0 in the WHERE clause, it shouldn't affect anything
		might have to add declaration rows for all the blocks for this to work with the old form control data

** control edit page
each page has a "Developer Comment" as the first control, where is this used and where is it set?
	used on BatchModify, clips image to ID location, so they can set it on that page for each sequence
	set this on block/batch edit page, load the blank image to get coords off first page
	not incredibly important, never set in old version (where would we save this info, if anywhere)

load a template image
change the header from KFI controls to control buttons:
	control type DDL
	add control
	save edits
	remove control
	move control up in sequence
	move control down in sequence
	move control right (vert skip)
	move control vertical (no vert skip)
	test controls button (go to text page)
	
find out how one of the forms shows two columns of controls:
	~E1 added to end of one of the controls
	E1 control is the left side control, there is a replace that remove the row end tag, thus making the right side control the second control in the list
	via fblnVertSkip column in rfrControls
	flgs that NEXT control is horizontal, not vertical (vertical skip)

add check boxes to each control for selection
each control also has:
	textbox for label
	textbox for gentax field
	two text boxes for marker coordinates (JS to drag it around?)
	two text boxes for image scroll coordinates
	dropdown for type of data and formatting if necessary (string, money, ssn, fein, etc)
	a dropdown for which control to move to next (also add "finish image" to this selection list)
put them all in an update panel for speed and postback awareness

each control needs to fill these columns
2	fstrGenTaxFieldName
3	fstrInputID
7	flngOrder
9	fstrColumn
10	fstrFormat
11	flngDispLength
12	flngMaxLength
13	flngVBVarType
15	fblnPostBack	(not currently used, but is sometimes filled, not consistent)
16	fblnVertSkip
17	fstrLabel
18	fstrOnFocus
19	fstrOnKeyDown
20	fblnActive	(always 1?)

these columns are for the form, all the same for each control (tax program, table, block)
1	fstrFileType
4	fstrTaxProgram
5	flngTaxYear
6	fstrTaxForm
8	fstrTable
14	flngBlock



** test page
just load up the test scan image and run through the controls
don't need to enter data, just tab through them to make sure all the marker and image scrolling works
